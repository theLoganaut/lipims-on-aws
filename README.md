<h1 align="center"> L.I.P.I.M.S </h1>
<p> 
LIPIMS is my fun twist on making an business management system, the twist being its made for a fake business in a Steampunk Sci-Fi world (think Arcane). It's a webapp that helps Logan (me!) handle running his banking business. He's discovered a portal system that allows an infinite amount of things to be stored, but they must be neat for easy employee retrieval. 
</p>

LIPIMS goal is to acheive a number of things, both inside and outside the world it's being 'created for';

- Create a real-world applicable a business management clone with Locations, Employees, Cost Overhead & Profit, Customer Banking.
- Further develop frontend skills in React and linking that to AWS services.
- Gain a stronger hands-on knowledge of creating and managing services in the AWS Cloud.
- Display this on my portfolio as a showcase to my software engineering skillset.
- Along the way get a better understanding of what working with a team would be like.

<h3 align="center"> Roadmap </h3>

- Changing base AWS CRUD to the base LIPIMS CRUD with business locations and their employee data. 

- Adding CRUD for a customer ledger that just holds info on gold and any items stored. 

- Add customer transaction and storage logs to database and give businesses and employees related data for analytics.  

- Give managers a BI dashboard to see cost. 

- Add Authentication with AWS Cognito that only allows verified users to log in, with roles for different user needs.  

- Serve a different view for non-managers and another for customers. 

- Revamp the view so it doesn't look like a framework. 

- Develop a seperate branch that would allow other businesses to use the Infinite Portals through an API.
